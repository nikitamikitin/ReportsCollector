1.How you can insure data consistency in case of server failures etc.?

The backup site service (without modifying their website or service) is very important to customers.
1. Have a copy of all the data in another data center.
2. In case of failure, switch the work to backup DC.


Regular database backup is an important step in data protection. In general, there are two broad categories of backups: backups at the file system level (“physical copies”) and logical backups. Physical backup (at the file system level) involves creating snapshots of the main data files at a certain point in time, which allows you to recover data using the state recorded in snapshots.


2.In case this server handles huge amount of events, how would you implement a feature that will need to preform complex aggregations?
